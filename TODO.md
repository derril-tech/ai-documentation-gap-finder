# AI Documentation Gap Finder â€” TODO.md

## P0 â€” Infrastructure & Core

- [x] Bootstrap repo & env (infra) â€” Docker Compose for Postgres+pgvector, Redis, NATS, MinIO; Vercel preview
- [x] Auth & RBAC â€” SSO stub + org/project roles (owner/admin/member), RLS scaffolding
- [x] Schemas & Migrations â€” Create tables (entities, docs, mappings, gaps, scores, drafts, exports, audit)
- [x] Observability wiring â€” OTel in API & workers; Prom metrics; Sentry DSN per env

## P1 â€” Workers & Analysis

- [x] clone-worker â€” shallow/sparse clone, LFS; per-project queue; rate limit/Backoff
- [x] scan-code-worker (TS/JS, Python) â€” symbol extractor, OpenAPI/GraphQL ingest, CLI parsers
- [x] scan-docs-worker â€” MD/MDX parse (headings/anchors/link graph, code blocks)
- [x] map-worker â€” embeddings + heuristics (name/path/signature) â†’ mappings with score & relation
- [x] diff-worker (schema drift, broken links, snippet test runs)
- [x] score-worker â€” readability, completeness, freshness, example density

## P1 â€” Frontend & UI

- [x] Gap Explorer UI â€” filters, severity chips, owner assignment
- [x] DriftDiff view â€” side-by-side spec deltas; per-field badges
- [x] draft-worker â€” MDX skeletons, tables, request/response examples; Mermaid diagrams
- [x] Draft Studio â€” editor + preview; snippet tests; link checker
- [x] PR export to docs repo â€” branch naming, changelog, preview links
- [x] Bundle export (JSON/PDF) â€” findings/mappings/drafts/scores
- [x] Telemetry ingestion (optional) â€” endpoint usage, 404 hits, searchâ€‘notâ€‘found

## Phase Summary

**P0 â€” Infrastructure & Core (COMPLETED)**
- âœ… Complete infrastructure setup with Docker Compose
